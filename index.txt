About me

I'm Creative Director and UI/UX Designer from Sydney, Australia, working in web development and print media. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design for many famous brand companies.

Education

Monacan Highschool
2020 — 2024
In my time at Monacan High School, I've taken on a rigorous curriculum, particularly in the humanities program. I've also been proactive in furthering my education beyond high school boundaries, completing two classes at our local community college. My thirst for knowledge didn't stop there; I also took on Advanced Placement Computer Science among other advanced classes. In addition to my academic pursuits, I've been dedicated to giving back to my school community by serving as a peer mentor. This experience allowed me to guide incoming freshmen and provide them with the support they needed in their transition into high school. Throughout all these endeavors, I've been thrilled to excel alongside my classmates and in my studies.


Experience

Intern
2021 — 2023
During my internship at WatchGang, I had the opportunity to develop an automated blog post system on WordPress, an experience that significantly honed my technical skills. This project was followed by a migration to Shopify, where I learned the intricacies of efficient inventory management. Throughout these processes, I collaborated closely with a diverse team of designers and business professionals, ensuring smooth operational flow. These experiences have provided me with a well-rounded understanding of multiple aspects of e-commerce operations and enhanced my ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams.

Lead programmer (FTC Team 7429)
2022 — Present
As the Lead Programmer on my First Tech Challenge (FTC) team, I was entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing a dedicated group of individuals, all working towards the common goal of creating an automated robot. This role required me to leverage my Java programming skills extensively, focusing on creating a system that offered positional control and incorporated AI computer vision. My responsibilities were not limited to programming; I also took an active role in the design and production process. I became proficient in using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools to design parts for our robot. Using various manufacturing methods, such as CNC machining, laser cutting, and 3D printing, I was able to bring these designs to life. This multifaceted role allowed me to showcase my technical skills while honing my leadership and collaborative abilities.

Web designer
2022 — present
As a freelance web developer, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects catering to various industries. I've created bespoke websites for small businesses, including landscapers, effectively capturing their services and brand ethos. In addition, I've designed engaging portfolios and gaming websites, tailoring each site's aesthetics and functionality to suit the specific needs of the client. My work also extends to the fashion industry, where I've developed clothing websites using WordPress. Furthermore, I've managed blogs, ensuring fresh and relevant content is consistently delivered to viewers. Each project has been a testament to my versatility and commitment to delivering quality web solutions.
